				<p>I feel like there's many things I want to do in the future. I don't have a particular job in mind but rather, I'm looking for a career where I can continually grow my skills, knowledge and where I can use technology to make an impact.</p>
				<p>I've always liked the idea of creating something visually appealing to people so I'd definitely say I have an interest in front-end development and roles in User Experience / User Interaction. But at the same time I really want to gain exposure to back-end development. I think in general, a career full-stack development would be very rewarding.</p> 
				<p>But honestly, at the end of the day I'm more than prepared for my plans to change. The workforce and vast career choices are continually evolving. That itself is very exciting. On a side note, I would love to take a post graduate course and work overseas! I'm really interested in going to Japan or China in the future so I hope I can learn one of these languages overtime. </p>
