		I was born in Hong Kong before coming here to Australia when I was about 3 years old. My Dad is Hong Kong and my Mum is Indonesian Chinese. I don't have any siblings and my relatives are either in Hong Kong or Indonesia. So it's only the three of us. I never learnt my monther tongue which makes me feel left out sometimes when I do go overseas to meet my relatives. Since then I've been really determined to practice my Mandarin! I think it'll really help me in the future if I were to meet my extended family again, make friends or in business.

	<h2 class = "center-align">My HSC</h2>
	<p class = "less-strict-container center-align">
		I completed the HSC in 2019. I studied Business Studies, Chinese Continuers, Software Design and Development, Maths Advanced and English Advanced. I was quite happy with my results and overall I think it was a good year. My favourite subjects were actually Business Studies and Chinese! I initially wanted to study Business or Commerce but at the end chose Information Technology. Nonethless, I hope that I can continue my interests in those subjects whilst studying IT!

<section id="computer-section">
	<h2 class = "center-align">Computers</h2>
	<p class = "less-strict-container center-align">
		I would say I have a basic level of computing experience. I can fix most of the computer issues my parents have and I've studied IT subjects in highschool such as IST and SDD. I've also played around with some projects before related to web development and games. But there's still a lot to learn!

	<h2 class = "center-align">Work</h2>
	<p class = "less-strict-container center-align">
		Throughout the last two years of highschool I've had some work experience. I had a casual job at McDonald's and then found another job as a restaurant waiter. The hospitality and food industry is a great place to start work but I would love experience related to my field in the future or try a casual job at retail. I've also recently got a job as a tutor so that's exciting!
